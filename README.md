# embedBot
Takes video file from discord, uploads to Streamable, and posts link back in discord. This prevents having users download the video themselves.

## Project Details
Feel free to use all code for any purpose denoted under the ISC license. I do however urge you to not duplicate the bot, but rather use it as an example for your own, hopefully beter, projects.

## TODOs:
### Prep for mass deployment
Allow bot to ask for server admin's username/password for Streamable, as to not use mine for every server.

Find better hosting solution, currently deployed on my personal PC.

### Quality of life
Code cleanup

Not be lazy and use issues section instead of posting todos on the readme :^)
