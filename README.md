# embedBot
Mostly complete. Takes video file from discord, uploads to Streamable, and posts link back in discord. This prevents having users download the video themselves.

## TODOs:
### Prep for mass deployment
Allow bot to ask for server admin's username/password for Streamable, as to not use mine for every server.

Find better hosting solution, currently deployed on heroku.

### Quality of life
Code cleanup

edit original upload message and replace it with new link instead of bot posting?

Not be lazy and use issues section instead of posting todos on the readme :^)
